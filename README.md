Picture gallery JQuery plugin

LICENSE:
I release the prictures plugin under the BSD license.  Do what you want with it.  If you have
any change suggestions, let me know, or just make it your own.  

ABOUT:
I originally started this project many moons ago. Literally 5 years ago.  At that time, jQuery
wasn't huge, and I was all of the javascript witout it.  I built a little photo gallery script
that supported multi-page galleries, and was tight and clean.  After a few year hiatus, I jumped
back into my long lost project with a few more ideas, and jQuery in my toolbox to help.  Now it
is a much more complex beast, but with the same simple objective.  That objective is to allow
people to build galleries of images with minimal coding experience.  The big thing with this
is that it can be used on media other that it can be used locally (on disc media for portfolios
or photo delivery for photographers or just a nice way to comment on a photo gallery) or hosted
online without the use of any complex server-side coding.

HOWTO:
I tried to keep this as simple as possible.
